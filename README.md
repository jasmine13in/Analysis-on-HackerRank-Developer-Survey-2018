# Analysis-on-HackerRank-Developer-Survey-2018
Analysis on a survey conducted by HackerRank to ask developers about their age, educational background, skills and more.

## Context
HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com), building a platform to create the best experience for both individuals and companies, conducted a survey of their developers late in 2016 in order to provide more transparency for themselves and the world on the state of developers. The survey asked developers many questions around their skills, educational background, current role, and more. The data set they released is the full dataset of 25K responses from our developer survey, which includes both students and professionals.

## Key Visualization and Insights

### 2. What are the Most Important Qualifications Hiring Managers are Looking for?
If the respondents choosed "Yes" in Q16 (Do you interview people as part of your company's hiring process),   they picked three of the most important qualifications they look for in an engineering candidate before the onsite.

#### Insights:
1. Big Data, Security, Development, Data Science, Cloud and Machine Learning have a huge scope in the future. It is evident that with the increasiing data, we need to save the data, thus we need Cloud, then we need to analyze and build automative systems, for this we need Data Science and Machine Learning and Security for storing the data. Thus candidates developing skills in these domains have a bright future ahead.
2. The picture of Big Data looks good, however, in the question of current roles, the ranking of Data Scientist is 9 and it is the only one made top 10. Why this domain is in high demand but the group of people work on data is not as big as we thought? It is impossible that data positions demand very comprehensive capability for candidates, such as programming languages, statistics, modeling, analytical mind.. Employers are willing to pay them a lot, while not many can be good at all those skills.


### 3.How Well Respondents Like Programming Languages When People Know or Will Learn and When People Already Know?
Programming plays an important role in programming, and people should know how to read and write code written in different programming languages.

#### Insigths:
1. Users of HackerRank like Python best! Is doesn't mean Python has the largest user population, but it is apparently that Python performs better than all the other languages, maximizing coder satisfaction.
2. Put both of above two plots together, I found that the heights of hate bars in the first chart are shorter than those in the second chart. This indicates that people usually feel bad at the very beginning of their coding study or they worry about if they can handle the language, but they feel a lot better when they really master it.
